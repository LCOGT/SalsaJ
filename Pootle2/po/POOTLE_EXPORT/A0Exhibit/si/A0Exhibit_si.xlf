        <source>Here, D is the distance to the Moon, which is hidden somewhere in this poster. If you want to calculate δ be careful that d and D are in the same units! You obtain δ in radian.  Now, we said we need 10 pixels to sample our image of the man, so our spatial resolution Θ should be equal to δ/10  Using the formula of the spatial resolution, and the center wavelength of the visible spectrum (it’s probably somewhere on another poster, you will have to look for it – again: be careful with the units!), you can now calculate the diameter of the telescope you will have to build.  You have it? Here’s a hint: it’s roughly the width of Central park in New York. It’s also 3 times the height of the Eiffel Tower…  This explains why astronomers always thrive for bigger telescopes! And the spatial resolution issue becomes critical at longer wavelengths. For radio observations, the telescopes are gigantic.</source>

We call that a blueshift.  If the photon is going away, then that’s the other way around, the wavelength becomes longer. For our yellow photon, its colour turns to red. It’s a redshift!  So the Doppler effect gives information about the speed of what we are observing. For example, you can see if a star if moving away from us or if it’s coming in our direction, and we can know at what speed it moves.   It’s very useful because knowing the kinematic of the object you are observing allow you to try to reproduce it’s behaviour with computer programs, it’s called modelling. Once you have reproduce a computer model that fits a lot of observation, you can apply it to predict other observations, or guess what’s going to happen to your source in a billion years. For example, with a 3m telescope, you can observe the hydrogen emission line at 21cm. Pointing it to the Milky Way will give you a spectrum, which in that case is the density of hydrogen with respect to its velocity. If along your line of sight you intercepted two spiral arms of the Milky Way moving at a different speed, your spectrum will have two peaks, each at the velocity of its respective arm.   So, with radio observation, I can reconstruct the spiral arms of the Milky Way. How cool is that?!">
