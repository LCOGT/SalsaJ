msgid "Imagine light as a superposition of many individual waves that have different wavelengths (a wavelength is the distance over which the wave’s pattern repeats). For the light visible by human eyes, each wavelength can be associated with a colour. Have you ever tried illuminating a prism with a lamp? You obtain a beautiful rainbow, which is revealing the decomposition of the visible light into its single colours (or single wavelengths).  For a human eye, the visible range of wavelength lies between 400 and 700 nanometres (0.000000001 metres). We can see 400 nm as blue, and 700 nm as red.  But there are more wavelengths that our eyes cannot see: some shorter than blue, and some longer than red."

FM radio emissions for example, are harmless to us. In the Universe at large, energetic phenomenon like supernovae emits lots of X-Rays and Gamma Ray which are even more energetic than UV.

The way they propagate strongly depends on their wavelength, and we take advantage of these different modes of propagation to create our very complex and diverse communication system:"

msgid "Kilometre wavelengths propagate through surface waves and follow the curvature of the Earth. With enough emission power, they can reach up to 1000 km. They also propagate under water, that’s why they are often used by submarines. Be careful though, it’s not Sonar! Sonar stands for SOund Navigation And Ranging. It’s a technique that uses sound propagation underwater, not light!  Amateur radio operators use decametre wavelengths. These wavelengths are very interesting because they are reflected by the Earth’s ionosphere. This means that an amateur radio signal sent to the sky bounces onto the ionosphere back to Earth, and propagates very far. Sometimes it can even reach the antipodes! Why sometimes? Well the reflection processes depends on the state of the ionosphere.  Wavelengths below about a metre propagate directly in straight lines from the emitter, almost like visible light. It’s the domain of FM broadcasting, TV emission, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc. These wavelengths are less affected by the ionosphere, that’s why we need satellites to relay them and send them back to Earth."

You could shout it very loudly but it would require a huge amount of energy to be heard, which would most likely result in a sore throat and some angry neighbours… Instead you could use your flashlight, translate it into Morse code and send it to your friend. By doing that, you have solved the problem of energy and distance, but you have lost a lot of information in the process. To keep all the information, you have to code the light you are sending in a specific way, so that your friend can receive and decode it easily.  This is called signal processing. Frequency Modulation (FM yes, like in FM radio!) is a kind of signal processing that is very easy and cheap to implement. You just modulate the light signal you are sending (the carrier wave) by varying its instantaneous frequency according to that of your message (your song for example). The signal is sent «modulated», and your radio «demodulates» it back to its original form and transmits it to its speakers, thus converting light back into sound!"

msgid "The ionosphere is a layer of electrons and other electrically charged particles in the upper atmosphere. It starts at around 80 km from the ground. At this altitude, the atmosphere is too thin to shield the particles from the Solar radiation. Atoms and molecules are hit directly with very energetic light like UV and X-Ray, and this causes them to break and lose some electrons. Their neutral balance is disturbed and they become electrically charged. The resulting mixture of electrons and charged particles is called plasma, and it is responsible for the reflection power of the ionosphere at decametre wavelengths.  During the day, Sunbeams hit the ionosphere and produce a lot of charged particles; the ionosphere becomes unstable and cannot reflect the radio signals very efficiently. But at night, the ionosphere is less perturbed and almost acts as a smooth mirror. This is why amateur radio operators prefer to send their long-distance call during the night!"

Or simply put:   So, the more precision we want, the bigger the telescope must be, especially at high wavelengths.  How big? Well, let’s do the maths. Let say I want to see someone standing on the Moon with an optical telescope., and to see him with a bit of detail, I want to make an image of him that has a height of 10 pixels. The man on the Moon is 2m tall.  First, let’s calculate his apparent size. The apparent size is the angle δ under which an object of size d is seen at a distance D. Using trigonometric relations, it’s fairly easy to find that sin(δ) = d/D. As δ is very small, this simplifies to δ ≈ d/D.  "

Here’s a hint: it’s roughly the width of Central park in New York. It’s also 3 times the height of the Eiffel Tower…  This explains why astronomers always thrive for bigger telescopes!

msgid "As the photon approaches, its wavelength is shortened in front of it. If it’s originally a yellow photon, then it’s colour turns to blue. We call that a blueshift.  If the photon is going away, then that’s the other way around, the wavelength becomes longer. For our yellow photon, its colour turns to red. It’s a redshift!  So the Doppler effect gives information about the speed of what we are observing. For example, you can see if a star if moving away from us or if it’s coming in our direction, and we can know at what speed it moves.   It’s very useful because knowing the kinematic of the object you are observing allow you to try to reproduce it’s behaviour with computer programs, it’s called modelling. Once you have reproduce a computer model that fits a lot of observation, you can apply it to predict other observations, or guess what’s going to happen to your source in a billion years. For example, with a 3m telescope, you can observe the hydrogen emission line at 21cm. Pointing it to the Milky Way will give you a spectrum, which in that case is the density of hydrogen with respect to its velocity. If along your line of sight you intercepted two spiral arms of the Milky Way moving at a different speed, your spectrum will have two peaks, each at the velocity of its respective arm.   So, with radio observation, I can reconstruct the spiral arms of the Milky Way. How cool is that?!"

You will be guided through some exercises to reconstruct the spiral arms of the Milky Way, or search for Dark Matter, with the spectra you will obtain yourself. And you can see the results of your commands in real-time on the telescope thanks to a webcam filming it 24h a day.  "

That means that we can observe large structures, like other galaxies, very far away."

We accidentally discovered an additional noise of unknown origin during observations on the wavelength 7.35 cm. This noise corresponds to a sky temperature of 2.7 K. And it fills the entire sky almost uniformly! We think that we detected the Cosmic Microwave Background predicted by the Big Bang theory."
