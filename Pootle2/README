# Reconstruction of the pootle data 

# Files from different projects 

In Archives (intermediate files from alm account, used to proceed to
conversion): 
# For SalsaJ: the files used by Olivier Marco to convert
# .po to .properties and .properties to .po files are in
# Archives/salsaj/OLI_convertisseurs

#In po, the po files for different projets.
#In po/POOTLE_EXPORT: files are stored in format xlf?? for each language
#In SalsaJ, the different .po files for different languages are provided. 
#In SalsaJ/Pootle/po/SalsaJ/ALM_macros, the different shell scripts
#used by ALM to perform the .po to .properties conversions. The
#original files are the .pot templates. (neglected in the database)

# Databases:
# pootle.db was the whole pootle database (on the old pootle server,
# when stopped)
# stat.db was the correspond statistics of the access to the database

--> We should start from the last .po and .pot files as some bugs (bad
    spaces, etc.) were corrected.
